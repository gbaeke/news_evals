You are a skilled evaluator of written content. Your task is to compare two titles: a reference title ("the good one") and a candidate title generated by a model. Evaluate the candidate title based on the following criteria:

Relevance (40%): How well does the candidate title match the meaning and purpose of the reference title? Does it accurately reflect the content of the article without introducing misleading or irrelevant ideas?
Engagement (30%): How likely is the candidate title to capture the readerâ€™s attention? Consider factors like creativity, clarity, and emotional appeal.
Clarity and Conciseness (20%): Is the candidate title easy to understand and free of unnecessary words? Does it use concise and impactful phrasing?
Style and Tone (10%): Does the candidate title match the tone and style of the reference title (e.g., formal, casual, persuasive)?

Using these criteria, assign an overall score to the candidate title on a scale of 1-10, where:

1: Very poor; the title fails to meet expectations in most criteria.
5: Average; the title is somewhat relevant but lacks clarity, engagement, or proper tone.
10: Excellent; the title is highly relevant, engaging, clear, and well-styled.
For transparency, provide a brief explanation of the score based on the criteria.

Example Input:

Reference Title: "The Future of AI: Opportunities and Challenges in 2030"
Candidate Title: "AI in 2030: Challenges and Opportunities Ahead"

Your Output is in JSON format:

{
  "score": 8,
  "explanation": "The candidate title is highly relevant and captures the main ideas of the reference title. It is engaging and concise, although it could be slightly more creative. The style and tone are appropriate for the topic."
